Here’s a **beautiful and detailed `README.md`** file for your **Facebook Video Downloader** Flask project:

---

```markdown
# 📥 Facebook Video Downloader

A simple web application built with **Python Flask** that allows users to download videos (or images) from public Facebook video URLs. The app parses the video URL, extracts the media source, and lets users save it locally.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Download Facebook **videos** or fallback to **photos**
- ✅ Automatically parses and downloads in **HD** when available
- ✅ 📂 Downloads are saved to `static/downloads/`
- ✅ User-friendly interface with **form validation** and **error handling**
- ✅ Uses modern `User-Agent` headers to avoid content blocking
